Sopherim
========

Sopherim is a software that allows you to open, read and edit ebook in EPUB format. It is roughly based on EPUB 3 specifications defined at www.idpf.org

My hope is that Sopherim becomes the best free EPUB editor of the market in the coming months and years.

Features : 

- Free and open source.
- Written in Java, with the GUI written almost completely in Java FX.
- Strictly based on EPUB specifications
- Can read and edit EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 easily.
- Graphical user interface in French and English
- Include epubcheck validator to validate your file.
- Avaible on Windows, Linux and Mac 0S.
- And so on...

Who am I : 

I'm a young computer scientist. I love to develop softwares, most of the time in Java. I'm living in Belgium and I hope Sopherim will be the first of a long list of softwares I expect to develop in the future. 

UPDATE 2014/04/09

I'm happy to announce that a first version of Sopherim should be available on July 2015. The implementation is still ongoing but the main functionalities are ready.
