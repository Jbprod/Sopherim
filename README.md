Sopherim
========

Sopherim is a software that allows you to open, write and edit ebook in EPUB format. It is roughly based on EPUB 3 specifications defined at www.idpf.org

It has many pros : 

- Free and open source.
- Written in Java, with the GUI written almost completely in Java FX.
- Strictly based on EPUB 3 specifications
- Include epubcheck validator to validate your file.
- And so on...

I've already implemented most of the functionalities. I hope the software would be released near April 2014, but I'm encountering some minor problems that could delay the current deadline.
