Sopherim
========

Sopherim is a software that allows you to open, read and edit ebook in EPUB format. It is roughly based on EPUB 3 specifications defined at www.idpf.org

My hope is that Sopherim becomes the best free EPUB editor of the market in the coming months and years.

Features: 

- Free and open source (for the basic version).
- Written in Java, with the GUI written almost completely in Java FX.
- Strictly based on EPUB specifications
- Can read and edit EPUB 2 and EPUB 3.
- Graphical user interface in French and English
- Include epubcheck validator to validate your publication.
- Avaible on Windows, Linux and Mac 0S.
- And so on...

Requirements:

To run Sopherim, you'll need to update your Java version to the last one (At this time, Java 8). This is necessary because Sopherim uses librariries and controls provided by this Java version. 

Who am I : 

I'm a young computer scientist. I love to develop softwares, most of the time in Java. I'm living in Belgium and I hope Sopherim will be the first of a long list of softwares I expect to develop in the future. 

UPDATE 2015/07/10

I'm sorry to announce the previous deadline (mid-July) cannot be met. I had some big bugs during the development and it took a lot of time to fix them. The bÃªta version should be available now in mid-December. Thanks for your patience and sorry for the inconvenience.
