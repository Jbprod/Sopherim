Sopherim
========

Sopherim is a software that allows you to open, write and edit ebook in EPUB format. It is roughly based on EPUB 3 specifications defined at www.idpf.org

It has many pros : 

- Free and open source.
- Written in Java, with the GUI written almost completely in Java FX.
- Strictly based on EPUB 3 specifications
- Available in French and English
- Include epubcheck validator to validate your file.
- And so on...

The development is ongoing, but the application couldn't be delivered in April. I still have some changes to do. I have also to review all the licenses in order to be sure I'm using it correctly. I have also to translate labels in French and English.

A snapshot version will be delivered soon, but I can't give a date. But don't be afraid, I'm doing all to make you happy.
